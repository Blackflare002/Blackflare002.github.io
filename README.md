I made a fun little Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS! This is actually the same game that I made with Ruby a while back, but now instead of being something that can only be played in a terminal, it's not a browser game! I did all the coding myself, of course, and I made the background images with AI -- Craiyon and Stable Diffusion.

Do you dare to enter the Doom Fortress?
